##Motivation      动机

The way we consume services from the Internet today includes many instances of streaming data, both
downloading from a service as well as uploading to it or peer-to-peer data transfers. Regarding
data as a stream of elements instead of in its entirety is very useful because it matches the
way computers send and receive them (for example via TCP), but is is often also a necessity 
because data sets frequently become too large to be handled as a whole. We spread computations
 or analyses over large clusters and call it "big data", where the whole principle of processing
 them is by feeding those data sequentially-- as a stream--though some CPUs.
